# Proactive installation of apps using Graph API and send messages

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Graph and Microsoft Teams public previews are available for early access and feedback. Although this release has undergone extensive testing, it is not intended for use in production.

## Proactive messaging in Teams

Proactive messages are initiated by bots to start conversations with a user. They serve many purposes including sending welcome messages, conducting surveys or polls, and broadcasting organization-wide notifications. Proactive messages in Teams can be delivered as either **ad-hoc** or **dialog-based** conversations:

|Message Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------- |
|Ad-hoc proactive message| The bot interjects a message without interrupting the conversation flow.|
|Dialog-based proactive message | The bot creates a new dialog thread, takes control of a conversation, delivers the proactive message, closes, and returns control to the previous dialog.|

See, [Send proactive notifications to users SDK v4](/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-proactive-message?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp&preserve-view=true).

## Proactive app installation in Teams

Before your bot can proactively message a user, it must be installed either as a personal app or in a team where the user is a member. At times, you need to proactively message users that have not installed or previously interacted with your app. For example, the need to message vital information to everyone in your organization. For such scenarios, you can use the Microsoft Graph API to proactively install your bot for your users.

## Permissions

Microsoft Graph [teamsAppInstallation resource type](/graph/api/resources/teamsappinstallation?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true) permissions helps you to manage your app's installation lifecycle for all user (personal) or team (channel) scopes within the Microsoft Teams platform:

|Application permission | Description|
|------------------|---------------------|
|`TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteSelfForUser.All`|Allows a Teams app to read, install, upgrade, and uninstall itself for any **user**, without prior sign in or use.|
|`TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteSelfForTeam.All`|Allows a Teams app to read, install, upgrade, and uninstall itself in any **team**, without prior sign in or use.|

To use these permissions, you must add a [webApplicationInfo](../../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#webapplicationinfo) key to your app manifest with the following values:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * **id** — your Azure AD app ID.
> * **resource** — the resource URL for the app.
>
>[!NOTE]
>
> * Your bot requires application and not user delegated permissions because the installation is for others.
>
> * An Azure AD tenant administrator must [explicitly grant permissions to an application](/graph/security-authorization#grant-permissions-to-an-application). After an application is granted permissions, all members of the Azure AD tenant gain the granted permissions.

## Enable proactive app installation and messaging

 > [!IMPORTANT]
>Microsoft Graph can only install apps published within your organization's [app catalog](../../concepts/deploy-and-publish/overview.md#publish-to-your-organizations-app-catalog) or in [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/).

### ✔ Create and publish your proactive messaging bot for Teams

To get started, you need a [bot for Teams](../../bots/how-to/create-a-bot-for-teams.md) with [proactive messaging](../../concepts/bots/bot-conversations/bots-conv-proactive.md) capabilities that is [published](../../concepts/deploy-and-publish/overview.md) in your organization's [app catalog](../../concepts/deploy-and-publish/overview.md#publish-to-your-organizations-app-catalog) or in [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/).

>[!TIP]
> The production-ready [**Company Communicator**](../..//samples/app-templates.md#company-communicator) app template permits broadcast messaging and is a good foundation for building your proactive bot application.

### ✔ Get the `teamsAppId` for your app

**1.** You need the `teamsAppId` for the next steps.

The `teamsAppId` can be retrieved from your organization's app catalog:

**Microsoft Graph page reference:** [teamsApp resource type](/graph/api/resources/teamsapp?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true)

**HTTP GET** request:

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/appCatalogs/teamsApps?$filter=externalId eq '{IdFromManifest}'
```

The request must return a `teamsApp` object. The returned object `id` is the app's catalog generated app ID and is different from the ID that you provided in your Teams app manifest:

```json
{
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "b1c5353a-7aca-41b3-830f-27d5218fe0e5",
      "externalId": "f31b1263-ba99-435a-a679-911d24850d7c",
      "name": "Test App",
      "version": "1.0.1",
      "distributionMethod": "Organization"
    }
  ]
}
```

**2.**  If your app has already been uploaded or sideloaded for a user in the personal scope, you can retrieve the `teamsAppId` as follows:

**Microsoft Graph page reference:** [List apps installed for user](/graph/api/userteamwork-list-installedapps?view=graph-rest-v1.0&tabs=http&preserve-view=true)

**HTTP GET** request:

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{user-id}/teamwork/installedApps?$expand=teamsApp&$filter=teamsApp/externalId eq '{IdFromManifest}'
```

**3.** If your app has been uploaded or sideloaded for a channel in the team scope, you can retrieve the `teamsAppId` as follows:

**Microsoft Graph page reference:** [List apps in team](/graph/api/team-list-installedapps?view=graph-rest-v1.0&tabs=http&preserve-view=true)

**HTTP GET** request:

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/teams/{team-id}/installedApps?$expand=teamsApp&$filter=teamsApp/externalId eq '{IdFromManifest}'
```

>[!TIP]
> To narrow the list of results, you can filter on any of the fields of [**teamsApp**](/graph/api/resources/teamsapp?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true) object.

### ✔ Determine whether your bot is currently installed for a message recipient

**Microsoft Graph page reference:** [List apps installed for user](/graph/api/userteamwork-list-installedapps?view=graph-rest-v1.0&tabs=http&preserve-view=true)

**HTTP GET** request:

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{user-id}/teamwork/installedApps?$expand=teamsApp&$filter=teamsApp/id eq '{teamsAppId}'
```

This request returns an empty array if the app is not installed and an array with a single [teamsAppInstallation](/graph/api/resources/teamsappinstallation?view=graph-rest-v1.0&preserve-view=true) object if the app is installed.

### ✔ Install your app

**Microsoft Graph page reference:** [Install app for user](/graph/api/userteamwork-post-installedapps?view=graph-rest-v1.0&tabs=http&preserve-view=true)

**HTTP POST** request:

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{user-id}/teamwork/installedApps

{
   "teamsApp@odata.bind" : "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/appCatalogs/teamsApps/{teamsAppId}"
}
```

If the user has Microsoft Teams running, app installation is seen immediately. A restart may be required to view the installed app.

### ✔ Retrieve the conversation **chatId**

When your app is installed for the user, the bot receives a `conversationUpdate` [event notification](../../resources/bot-v3/bots-notifications.md#team-member-or-bot-addition) that contains the necessary information to send the proactive message.

The `chatId` can also be retrieved as follows:

**Microsoft Graph page reference:** [Get chat](/graph/api/chat-get?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http&preserve-view=true)

**1.** You must need your app's `{teamsAppInstallationId}`. If you don't have it, use the following:

**HTTP GET** request:

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/users/{user-id}/teamwork/installedApps?$expand=teamsApp&$filter=teamsApp/id eq '{teamsAppId}'
```

The **id** property of the response is the `teamsAppInstallationId`.

**2.** Make the following request to fetch the `chatId`:

**HTTP GET** request (permission — `TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteSelfForUser.All`):  

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/users/{user-id}/teamwork/installedApps/{teamsAppInstallationId}/chat
```

The **id** property of the response is the `chatId`.

You can also retrieve the `chatId` with the following request but it requires the broader `Chat.Read.All` permission:

**HTTP GET** request (permission — `Chat.Read.All`):

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/users/{user-id}/chats?$filter=installedApps/any(a:a/teamsApp/id eq '{teamsAppId}')
```

### ✔ Send proactive messages

Your bot can [send proactive messages](/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-proactive-message?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp&preserve-view=true) after the bot has been added for a user or a team and has received all the user information.
